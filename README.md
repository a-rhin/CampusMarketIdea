**CampusMarket (subject to change)**

**ðŸŽ¯ Idea**
Many students in Ghana run small businesses (baking, selling clothes, food delivery, electronics, repairs, etc.), but lack a central platform to reach their peers. CampusMarket solves this by creating an online marketplace tailored for each university. they also intertrade (a student from UG can buy from a student seller in KNUST)

Each university will have its own tab/section (with their specific logo and colors).
Under each university, students can browse available categories such as:
Food & Beverages (cakes, snacks, local meals, etc.)
Fashion (clothes, shoes, accessories)
Electronics (gadgets, extension boards, rice cooker, etc.)
Services (repairs, tutoring, design, etc.)

This ensures that student entrepreneurs have a visible online space, and buyers can easily find trusted sellers within their campus community.

**ðŸš€ Goals**
Empower students to grow their small businesses.
Create a safe and trusted platform for campus-based commerce.
Encourage networking and collaboration among students.

**ðŸ”§ Tech Stack (Planned)**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (later React or Vue)
- Backend: (to be decided)
- Database: (to be decided)
- Deployment: GitHub Pages (initial testing) â†’ Cloud/Hosting later

**ðŸ“Œ Roadmap**
Build the basic website structure (frontend pages).
Add login & signup for students (maybe with school email verification).
Create university tabs and categories.
Enable product/service posting and browsing.
Integrate messaging between buyers and sellers.
Explore mobile app development for Android/iOS.
